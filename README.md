## Challenges Faced

### 1. Payment Integration

Integrating a payment system for users to become pro-user members posed a significant challenge. This involved implementing secure payment gateways, handling successful payments, and updating user roles upon successful transactions.

### 2. User Authentication

Implementing user authentication with email/password and social media authentication required careful consideration of security measures. Generating and storing JWT tokens on the client side, handling authentication for private routes, and integrating social login were key challenges.

### 3. Role Management

Creating user roles such as user, surveyor, admin, and pro-user with different permissions was crucial for effective access control. Implementing role-based access control for dashboard functionalities and managing user roles dynamically were challenges faced during development.

### 4. Dashboard Development

Creating dashboards for different user roles, including admin, surveyor, and pro-user, required careful planning. This involved displaying survey responses with tables and charts, managing survey statuses, and implementing feedback mechanisms for unpublished surveys.

### 5. Access Control (dashboard)

Implementing access control for various user roles in the dashboard was challenging. Admins needed the ability to manage users, change roles, and view survey responses, while surveyors and pro-users had specific permissions related to survey creation, feedback, and participation.
